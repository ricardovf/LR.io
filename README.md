# LR.io

This is a tool to manipulate regular languages.

It uses:

1. React
2. Redux

To run just make:

````
yarn install
yarn start
````

## Development resources

It uses hot module replacement so you just code and see the results.

We use *prettier* to keep the code style consistent. Active to run prettier on your IDE.

### To mantain redux state on reload

Use debug_session query on the url:

```
http://localhost:3000/?debug_session=whatever
```
